# Weather API Setup

To enable real weather data in your gamification app, you need to set up a free OpenWeatherMap API key.

## Steps:

1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Replace `'your_api_key_here'` in `/src/app/shared/services/weather.service.ts` with your actual API key

## Current Implementation:

- **Dynamic Greeting**: Changes based on time of day
  - 5 AM - 12 PM: "Good Morning"
  - 12 PM - 5 PM: "Good Afternoon" 
  - 5 PM - 9 PM: "Good Evening"
  - 9 PM - 5 AM: "Good Night"

- **Weather Display**: Shows temperature and location
  - Uses geolocation to get user coordinates
  - Fetches real-time weather data
  - Falls back to mock data if API key is not configured

## Features:

✅ Time-based dynamic greetings
✅ Real-time temperature display
✅ Location-based weather data
✅ Responsive design with proper styling
✅ Error handling and fallbacks
✅ Clean service architecture

The app will work with mock data (22°C, "Your Location") if no API key is provided, so you can test the functionality immediately!
